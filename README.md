# CPSC-4910 - Good (Truck) Driver Incentive Program

This project was a semester-long, group based project to gain experience on how a real-world software solution is designed and developed. We focused on the software development life cycle (SDLC) with weekly sprints and scrum meetings to mark our progress.

My group and I chose to develop a C# .NET MVC Web Application. The main reason for choosing .NET over other popular frameworks (NodeJS, Django, etc.) was .NET's Entity Framwork Core. This O/RM allowed us to create the entire MySql database without writing any SQL.
